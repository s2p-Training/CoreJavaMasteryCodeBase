/**
 *  Topics To Be Covered:
 *   Types Of Inner Class
 *      1. Nested Inner Class
 *      2. Local Inner Class
 *      3. Anonymous Inner Class
 *      4. static inner class
 *
 *     We can define a class inside another class.
 *     Outer class can have an inner class inside that is also called as inner class.
 *     If you have a class and it is becoming very big and complex.
 *     To reduce the complexity of bigger class. you can deifine the class inside another class.
 *     We can also deifine interface inside.
 *
 *     1. Nested Inner Class :
 *        a) Inner Class can access the members of outer class (It will be just like global variables for inner class)
 *        b) We can inner class by creating it's object inside inner class.
 *        c) Outer class can not access data memebers of inner class directly unless it has created the object of inner class.
 *        d) It is possible to create the object inner class outside of outer class but it is useless.
 *        e) For Every class in java, a separte compiled *.class is created, for inner class Outer$Inner.class file created
